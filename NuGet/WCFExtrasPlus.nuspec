    <description>Based on the WCFExtras project, which has been inactive, WCFExtras+ is a collection of useful WCF extensions including SOAP Header support, WSDL flattening and documentation, and more.</description>
    <releaseNotes>1. Fixed an issue with overriding the endpoint location when wsHttpBinding is used.
2. Several other enhancements to the code base that do not affect features of the library.
3. Line number three.
4. Line number four which is a long line that spans well over 80 characters so it is a good indicator of how this long string will look within the NuGet Package Explorer and how it will look in the online catalog.
